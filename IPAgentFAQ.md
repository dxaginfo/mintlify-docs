# IP Agent FAQ

### How is IP Agent different from traditional legal research tools?
Unlike traditional legal research tools that require users to learn complex search syntax, boolean operators, or navigate through multiple filters and dashboards, IP Agent accepts natural language questions as you would ask a human analyst. It not only retrieves relevant data but structures the information in a strategic, contextual way that adds immediate value for legal professionals.

### Who is IP Agent designed for?
IP Agent is designed primarily for IP attorneys, in-house counsel, law firm professionals, and anyone who needs to research and analyze U.S. IP legal data. It's particularly valuable for professionals who want to save time on research and focus more on analysis and strategy.

### What kind of data can IP Agent access?
IP Agent has access to comprehensive U.S. IP legal data, including PTAB cases, IPR proceedings, attorney and law firm performance metrics, ALJ information, patent data, and related litigation information. The database is regularly updated to ensure current information is available.
