- Performance metrics are recalculated monthly
- Historical trend data is refreshed quarterly

## Natural Language Processing Capabilities

### Query Processing

IP Agent employs advanced natural language processing to:
1. Parse natural language queries into structured database queries
2. Identify key entities (firms, attorneys, patents, dates, etc.)
3. Recognize query intent (performance analysis, case lookup, trend analysis, etc.)
4. Handle ambiguity through contextual understanding
5. Support follow-up questions that reference previous queries

### Response Generation

The system generates responses by:
1. Retrieving relevant data points from multiple databases
2. Structuring information in a logical, analyst-like format
3. Prioritizing information based on likely relevance to the query
4. Including contextual information that adds strategic value
5. Formatting responses for readability and comprehension

### Supported Query Types

IP Agent can process various query types including:
1. **Factual queries** - Specific information about cases, attorneys, or patents
2. **Analytical queries** - Performance trends, success rates, or comparative analysis
3. **Temporal queries** - Historical data or time-based trends
4. **Relational queries** - Connections between entities (attorneys, firms, cases)
5. **Hypothetical queries** - Projections based on historical patterns

   - Authentication via API keys
   - Rate limiting and usage monitoring

2. **Integration Capabilities**
   - Document management system integration
   - Case management software connections
   - Custom dashboard development
   - Reporting tool integration

## System Limitations

Users should be aware of the following current limitations:

1. **Query Complexity**
   - Very complex multi-part queries may need to be broken down
   - Extremely specialized technical terminology may require clarification

2. **Data Recency**
   - Very recent cases (less than 48 hours old) may not be fully indexed
   - Real-time updates are not currently supported

3. **Specialized Jurisdictions**
   - Focus is primarily on U.S. IP data
   - International patent information is limited
   - Some specialized administrative proceedings may have limited coverage

4. **Inference Capabilities**
   - The system provides data-driven insights but does not offer legal advice
   - Strategic recommendations are informational and should be professionally evaluated

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Ambiguous Queries**
   - System will request clarification
   - May offer multiple interpretation options
   - Will suggest query refinements

2. **Data Not Found**
   - Clear indication when requested information is not available
   - Suggestions for alternative queries
   - Explanation of data coverage limitations if relevant

3. **System Limitations**
   - Transparent communication when a query exceeds current capabilities
   - Suggestions for breaking complex queries into manageable parts

### Troubleshooting Steps

If experiencing issues with IP Agent:

1. **Query Refinement**
   - Be more specific with entity names
   - Include date ranges when relevant
   - Specify exact patent numbers when available

2. **Browser Issues**
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Ensure browser is updated to latest version
   - Disable interfering extensions

3. **Connection Problems**
