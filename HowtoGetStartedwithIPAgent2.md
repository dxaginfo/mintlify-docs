# **How to Get Started with IP Agent**

Welcome to Patexia IP Agent. I'm here to show you how to leverage this intuitive tool for accessing and analyzing U.S. intellectual property legal data. My goal is to transform how you interact with complex IP litigation data, making your research more efficient and insightful.

IP Agent streamlines your research by allowing you to query vast datasets using natural language. This means no more intricate dashboards or specialized filters. We empower you with data-driven insights, making sophisticated analysis accessible.

As Pedram Sameni, CEO of Patexia, states:

"The new IP Agent builds on that by enabling attorneys to query complex datasets in plain language, cutting on hours of manual analysis. We see it as a foundational step toward accessible legal research—shifting the power of analysis from dashboards to the legal professionals interpreting the data."

## **Step 1: Accessing Your IP Agent**

To begin, log into the Patexia platform. Once you're in, navigate to the IP Agent interface. You will find it clearly marked within your dashboard.

You will typically see IP Agent listed in the left-hand navigation menu. Simply click on "IP Agent" to open its main screen.

## **Step 2: Formulating Your Query with Natural Language**

The true power of IP Agent is its ability to understand your questions in plain English. I'm designed to surface precise insights across cases, firms, judges, and outcomes.

Just type your question into the "Ask IP Agent" input bar. You'll see prompt suggestions like "Try Cases, Attorneys, Law Firms, Companies and more" to help you get started. These are designed to give you a clear direction for exploring our extensive datasets.

### **Crafting Effective Prompts: Examples**

Here are some examples of prompts that demonstrate the range of questions you can ask. These show how you can combine various data points and criteria in a single, conversational query to get highly specific results:

* "Show me all the PTAB attorneys of Dewey, Cheatem & Howe LLP that were ranked among the top 100 best performing in 2024"  
* "Show me all cases of my firm that have been instituted this month. Then add the parties involved and the patent numbers"  
* "Show all IPR cases against Samsung that received the final written decision last year"  
* "Which ALJs had the highest invalidation rates in 2022?"  
* "Top law firms defending PTAB cases in biotech over the last 3 years?"

## **Step 3: Interpreting Structured Results**

After you submit your query, IP Agent processes your natural language input and returns answers in structured, actionable formats. These results are designed for immediate analysis and reporting, typically presented as concise summaries, interactive tables, or relevant charts.

### **Direct Answers and Summaries**

For specific factual queries, IP Agent provides clear, direct answers. If you ask for a precise percentage or a single data point, you will receive a straightforward textual response, giving you the exact information you need without further interpretation.

### **Interactive Tables for Detailed Analysis**

For queries involving multiple data points or requiring detailed comparisons, IP Agent often presents the information in sortable, filterable tables. These tables are a powerful way to explore complex data, allowing you to dive deep into specifics.

For example, asking about "Top PTAB Attorneys for Biotech Cases in 2024" might yield a table like this, providing a clear overview of relevant attorneys, their associated firms, and case counts:

### **Utilizing Table Controls**

To maximize your interaction with the data, pay attention to the table controls located at the top of your results. These controls allow you to:

* **Maximize:** Expand the table view for better readability and a more focused analysis.  
* **Export:** Download the data for further analysis in external tools like spreadsheets, giving you full control over your findings.  
* **Understand Variables:** Gain insights into the definitions and sources of the data presented, ensuring you have a complete context for your results.

*(Image 4 should be inserted here: This image shows the table controls typically found at the top of a data table, highlighting options like maximize, download, and information icons.)*

**Figure 4:** Table controls provide options to maximize, export, and understand the variables within your results.

You may also find options to interact with filters directly within the results. These quick filters allow you to easily manage and refine the displayed data on the fly, tailoring the information to your exact requirements without needing to re-enter a full query.

*(Image 5 should be inserted here: This image shows an example of interactive filters that appear within the table view, allowing users to quickly adjust the displayed data based on specific criteria.)*

**Figure 5:** Interactive filters allow you to refine your results directly within the table view.

## **Step 4: Refining Your Search and Asking Follow-Up Questions**

Your research journey with IP Agent is iterative. You are not limited to a single query; you can continuously refine your search or ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into the data. This capability allows for a dynamic and evolving research process.

The "Ask IP Agent" bar remains available below your results. This enables you to build upon previous queries, adding new layers of detail or changing parameters to gain more nuanced insights without losing the context of your ongoing research.
